Huge thank you to ______ for the python library LyricsGenius
Another huge thank you to ______ for the rust crate python-inline

the inline-python crate doesn't work with a stable version of Rust
so I had to install nightly Rust and build with that as well
I accidentally installed the racer crate also which turned out
to be super helpful

I initially wanted to do the entire project in Rust but unfortunately
the the Genius API does not provide lyrics for legal reasons
Fortunately LyricsGenius works just fine 
Edit the token line in python! section of the main.rs file
to stop the recurring request for your Genius API token.
